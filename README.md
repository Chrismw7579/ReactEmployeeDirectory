# ReactEmployeeDirectory
A react app that displays a table of employees

The table allows the user to sort the data based on each category by clicking on the column's label at the top. With the first input field the user can filter out any propery in the table like names, departments, or roles. The last two input fields are for the min and max values for the employees salaries. Any combination of the input fields can be used at the same time. The table can then be reset with the bottom "reset" button. The data of the employees is stored in a json file which is read and processed by the tableContainer component.
